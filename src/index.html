        <p>Hi &#128075</p>
        <p>I'm Lizzy, and I'm a software engineer in Pittsburgh, PA. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019 and am currently working for Maven Machines as a backend engineer. My current languages of choice are NodeJS and Python along with MySQL databases and Firebase. I'm also working on increasing my breadth of technology to become more full stack by learning frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and React.</p>

      <div id="bio">
        <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY, as the daughter of two engineers enjoying the Kodak boom. Because of this, there were always two themes running through my life: computers and sports. As far back as I can remember, we always had a computer in the house that my sisters and I could play on, and when I wasn't on the computer, I was probably playing soccer or volleyball or dancing.</p>

        <p>I graduated from Gates Chili High School in 2015 and decided to go to Carnegie Mellon as an electrical and computer engineering major (ECE) the following fall. While at CMU, I was also on the NCAA Varsity Volleyball team for all four years as a middle and was a TA for 15-112, the introductory programming class. I loved being part of a team in both aspects, where I had a group to depend on and who could, in turn, depend on me. I graduated from CMU in the spring of 2019 with a B.S. in ECE, an additional major in psychology, and a minor in computer science.</p>

        <p>After graduating, I became a part of the Venture For America 2019 fellowship, a group that is focused on developing the next generation of startup entrepreneurs and leaders. I also rejoined Maven Machines after my internship the summer before to be a full-time backend engineer working on the dispatch project.</p>

<!-- OLD BIO
I grew up in Rochester, NY and most of my immediate family still lives there. I have a twin sister studying Computer Science at the University of California Irvine and a little sister still in high school. My dad is a software engineer, so through him I went to a few coding camps over the summer and learned to really love software. However, my absolute favorite class in high school was AP Physics so going to college for Electrical and Computer Engineering seemed like a nice marriage.
Throughout middle school and high school, I also played volleyball. I played for the VolleyFX club teams for five years and we often went to Pittsburgh, PA for one of the last tournaments of the year. During that tournament was when I found Carnegie Mellon and fell in love with it on a campus tour.
My time at Carnegie Mellon has been amazing. I've made lots of good friends and the opportunities have been amazing. I love meeting so many intelligent people from tons of different backgrounds and passions, whether it be in academics or other extracurriculars. Being part of the volleyball team has been a life changing experience. Nothing has ever challenged me more or allowed me to become closer to such an amazing group of women.
CMU has also shown me my passion for software. Each summer, I've had an internship at a different software company and been able to delve into new technologies I wouldn't have seen before. One of the amazing courses that I've taken that started it all at 15-112, Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science. It showed me the power of code and what it meant to really know how to program. And, thankfully I've been able to give that back to students by becoming a TA for the course the past two springs.
And now I'm a senior, looking forward towards graduation and the last few courses I have left including my capstone. I can't wait to start in the real world.
