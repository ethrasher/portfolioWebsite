        <p>PianoMan</p>
        <p>PianoMan was my capstone project at CMU, completed over my senior spring semester. I was on a team of 3, where I was the main software engineer. PianoMan's goal was to help people learn to play piano by "gamifying" the experience and allowing learners to not need to look at and read sheet music while also learning what keys to press and timing. </p>

        <p>As the main software engineer, the goal for my part of the project was to be able to take a pdf image of sheet music and accurately turn that into a MusicXML file using computer vision and pattern recognition. I researched, designed, developed and tested the Optical Music Recognition (OMR) side of the project as well as the GUI and I also worked on integration testing with the other parts of the project.</p>

        <p>To see the full pipeline of how the OMR worked please see our final report <a target="_blank" href="http://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece500/projects/s19-teamd7/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2019/05/Final-Project-Report-Team-D7.pdf">here<a>. It is also summarized below.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Preprocessing the pdf by turning each page into a binarized jpg with little noise.</li>
          <li>Finding and removing all the staff lines by using horizontal projection.</li>
          <li>Finding all the connected components and running a template match on them.</li>
          <li>Running certain analyses on each component depending on what it matched to. Note heads were found using a Hough Circle Transform.</li>
          <li>Notes, rests, and accents were reorganized based on their position on each staff into measures. Accents were put onto notes or used as a key signature when appropriate.</li>
          <li>A MusicXML file was generated.</li>

        <p>Parthean's Web Dev in 10 days</p>
        <p>Parthean is an ed-tech company started by one of my friends from college: Arman. While I do a lot of backend work in my job and throughout CMU, I hadn't done much full stack or frontend work. I decided to take his "Web Dev in 10 days" course to help him product test as well as learn something myself about building a full web app.</p>
        <p>The idea was that each day was either a tutorial or a project description to work through and progressively you would work up through each technology.</p>

        <p>React Todo App - learning React</p>
        <p>After going through the Parthean course, I felt more confident in my basic frontend and full stack work. But I knew I wanted to learn React as well. </p>
        <p>React is one of the most popular frontend frameworks today and what my company currently uses. Since my goal was to become more of a full stack engineer, I knew learning React would be one of the next steps.</p>
        <p>This project came from a tutorial on React and explained how to build a simple todo app</p>

        <p>VITA</p>
        <p>During the fall of 2018, I took a class called Computer For Good at CMU. This was a project based class that was focused on helping members of the Pittsburgh community. My group chose to help the Hillman Cancer Institute, and with the advisement of doctors and researchers there, we built a cross-platform app to help patients track their quality of life symptoms and allow doctors to more easily see what was affecting their patients.</p>
        <p>I led a team of 4 others to organize and work on the software development side of the project. We decided on using flutter because it was cross-platform, allowing us to build both an iPhone and an Android app in the short span of a semester. Plus, this project was primarily front-end focused.</p>
        <p>I personally built many of the pages of the app shown in the video while working with UI designers and adjusting for information we gained during user studies. I also organized the development team and made sure everyone was on track with their projects and helped compensate when they weren't.</p>

        <p>Dance Dance Revolution</p>
        <p>During the spring semester of 2018, I participated in Build18 with a group of 4 others to build Dance Dance Revolution.</p>
        <p>Build18 is an annual, weeklong hackathon for electrical and computer engineers at CMU. Projects can be whatever you want but should include both some hardware and some software component.</p>
        <p>I was in charge of creating the software part of the game that would take in input from the Arduino about foot presses and control an event-based Pygame program to respond appropriately by starting the correct using and keeping track of score when foot presses occur at the right time.</p>
