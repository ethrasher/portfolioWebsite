        <p>Maven Machines</p>
        <p>I started at <a href="https://mavenmachines.com/" target="_blank">Maven Machines</a> as an intern over the summer of 2018. After graduation, I re-joined as a full time backend engineer in August of 2019.</p>
        <p>Maven Machines is an IOT startup in Pittsburgh focused on developing solutions to improve efficiency in industrial applications. For now, it is primarily focused on the trucking and manufacturing space.</p>
        <p> As part of the <a href="https://mavenmachines.com/solutions/dispatch-software/" target="_blank">Dispatch</a> and <a href="https://mavenmachines.com/solutions/route-planning-software/" target="_blank">Inbound</a> squads, I am in charge of developing features, fixing bugs, and owning incidents within the micro-service architecture. We primarily worked with NodeJS, MySQL, Firestore, and both rpcs and HTTP requests. I am also part of the on-call rotation and a consistent member in our release process. In March of 2020, I moved to the inbound squad as the sole backend developer and am the owner of the entire backend of that project including working with customers, the product management team, and the support team to determine what was needed and how to build it.</p>

        <p>Venture For America</p>
        <p>I am part of the 2019 fellow class with <a href="https://ventureforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Venture For America</a> and will graduate the fellowship in July 2021.</p>
        <p>Venture For America is a fellowship for recent graduates looking to become the next entrepreneurs and startup leaders in the US. It is a way to build a network and learn entrepreneurial and leadership skills through training and the VFA community.</p>
        <p>I found VFA through interning at Maven and applied during my senior year. Since then, I've joined the Pittsburh cohort and been through lots of in person, and now virtual, training and networking events. I also participated in training camp and redux: the two largest training sessions across all of VFA, posed as a "summer camp for entrepreneurs."</p>

        <p>TA for 15-112</p>
        <p>I was a TA for <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/" target="_blank">15-112</a>: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science at CMU for 3 semesters: Spring 2017, Spring 2018, Spring 2019. I really loved working as a TA and would have done it more if not for also being on the CMU Varsity Volleyball team.</p>
        <p> 112 is one of the first programming course most students take at CMU and is one of the most well known and well regarded courses in the world. It is in python and covers everything from if statments, loops, and arrays to GUIs, recursion, and OOP. It ends with a final "capstone" project that each student develops from scratch and presents.</p>
        <p> As a TA, every week I would teach recitation, hold 2-3 hours of office hours, taught lab, planned and taught small groups for review, and of course graded. I learned more soft skills here too than almost anywhere else, including explaining technical concepts and having and showing empathy to confused students.</p>

        <p>I was an intern at <a href="https://www.allstontrading.com/" target="_blank">Allston Trading</a> during the summer of 2017 as a backend software engineer. </p>
        <p>Allston Trading is a FinTech company centered in Chicago. They are focused on building technology and tooling to help traders make better trades on primarily securities and options.</p>
        <p>At Allston I worked primarily in Python and MySQL on a security master, essentially a tool that would organize and store data so that traders could look at all the data and use it in their trading. I first worked on a project to improve performance in the system by ~40% by consolidating some classes and making some other tweaks. After that I worked on a script for to help with monitoring. The security master needs to download market data several times a day, but if this fails then data is lost from the system and is not recoverable. I created a script that would monitor the downloads and make sure they were running appropriately by making use of a variety of different design patterns.</p>

        <p>I used the C language, and created some return-oriented programming attacks. I worked on a project with the intent to automate finding return-oriented programming attacks by creating shell-scripts, test-cases, and researched known programs with vulnerabilities using the CVE database.</p>

        <p>I did research with eye-tracking devices and performed two experiments. One the professor designed where we shifted parts of an image and determined how close they could be with someone being able to tell they were different. The other I designed to test differences in eye movements when reading from a paper book versus on a screen. Then the results were put together in a powerpoint and presented to a group at the end of the summer. My blog from the summer is <a href="http://lizzythrasherinternship2014.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
